Pete's Simple MIDI SysEx Transfer Utility

What we don't collect
---------------------

This app **does not collect** any personal information. I like you, and appreciate your business, but I don’t really want to know anything else about you. Let's just keep this relationship professional.

What we collect
---------------

All Microsoft Store (and other app store) applications capture basic analytics to help ensure the success and stability of the app. This app is no different. This information includes the number of installations, basic usage hours, etc.

In addition to what the store normally collects and reports, a count of successful transmissions, canceled transmissions, and errors in transmissions is retained as part of these analytics. This is a simple event with no additional information. No filenames or other information are reported.

Access to your local files
--------------------------

This app requires access to local files in order to transmit them to your device. The files are not retained or transmitted in any way other than over the MIDI connection you choose when using the app. In other words: we only use the local file(s) for your purpose you intended.

Access to your MIDI device
--------------------------

This app requires access to your MIDI device in order to transmit the SysEx file(s). You are in complete control as to which MIDI device is used through your choice in the app.

What you can do
---------------

As you can see, we don't really collect anything special, but if you are unhappy with the information being captured, or anything else covered here, please uninstall the app.
