# Windows 10 MIDI SysEx Utility

Very simple MIDI SysEx transfer utility using the Windows 10 MIDI API. Supports sending SysEx files, including operating system upgrades for MIDI devices, with a configurable message/buffer size and delay.

Uses my Windows 10 MIDI library, which supports all Windows 10 MIDI features, including Bluetooth LE MIDI.

Screen shot of the app transferring an operating system upgrade for the Elektron Analog Four. (The delay was there just to screen shot it. The real OS transfer was done with a buffer size of 128 and delay of 0).
