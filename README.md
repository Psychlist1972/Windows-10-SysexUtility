# Windows 10 MIDI SysEx Utility

Very simple MIDI SysEx transfer utility using the Windows 10 MIDI API. Supports sending SysEx files, including operating system upgrades for MIDI devices, with a configurable message/buffer size and delay.

Uses my Windows 10 MIDI library, which supports all Windows 10 MIDI features, including Bluetooth LE MIDI.
